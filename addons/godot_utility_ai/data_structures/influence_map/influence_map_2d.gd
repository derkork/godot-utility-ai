## Returns the position of the maximum influence within the given radius of the given position. Note that this
## is a heuristic and not guaranteed to return the actual maximum influence position. You can tune the accuracy
## and speed of this function using the step_limit and scale parameters. The step_limit determines how many
## steps are taken to find the maximum influence position. The scale determines the size of the steps. 
## Increasing the amount of steps may increase the accuracy of the result but also increases the computation time.
## The step size is in world unit and determines the size of the steps. Bigger step sizes can help to avoid 
## finding a local maximum instead of the global maximum but they can also cause the function to miss the maximum
## entirely. So you may need to experiment with these parameters to find the right balance between accuracy and speed.
